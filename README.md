# DSCL-EXP-Malloc-Calloc-
Short description: This C program demonstrates the usage of dynamic memory allocation and pointer manipulation.

Algorithm:

Declare a character pointer "ptr". Allocate 2 bytes of memory to "ptr" using malloc() function and assign the memory address to "ptr". Assign 'A' to the memory location pointed by "ptr". Print the value and memory address of the memory location pointed by "ptr". Increment "ptr" to point to the next memory location. Assign 'B' to the memory location pointed by the updated value of "ptr". Print the value and memory address of the updated memory location pointed by "ptr". Exit the program.

Output: The program outputs the value and memory address of the memory locations pointed by the character pointer "ptr". The output is as follows:

A 2271104 B 2271105
